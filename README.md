# Process Automation Engineer | Remote | SQL Developer | BI & Python Automation

# Hi, I'm Vivian 👋

I'm a **Process Automation Engineer** working fully remotely. I have ~15 years of experience turning repetitive, manual, error‑prone work into reliable automated systems.

I specialise in **SQL**, **Python**, **ETL pipelines**, and **Power BI**, helping businesses move from "we do this manually every week" to "this updates itself."

Based in the UK (Belfast), working fully remotely.

## 🚀 Featured Project

### [ETL Customer Sales Demo](https://github.com/mrvivian/ETL_CustomerSales_Demo)
An end-to-end ETL pipeline that extracts customer & sales data, validates it, applies data quality checks, and loads it into SQL Server.

- Full ETL flow (extract → transform → load)
- Realistic validation rules and auditing
- Built with SSIS + SQL Server in a clean, portfolio-friendly format
- Demonstrates maintainable, production-style pipelines

## 💡 What I Actually Do

My focus is simple: **eliminate repetitive work and make data trustworthy.**

In practice, that means I:
- Build automated scripts that clean, process, and move data
- Design ETL pipelines so data flows without human intervention
- Create dashboards and reports that refresh themselves
- Integrate AI tools into workflows when they add real value
- Reduce processes that take hours… down to minutes

Most of my work sits at the intersection of **SQL**, **Python**, **ETL**, and **Business Intelligence**.
