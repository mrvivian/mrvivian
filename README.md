**Process Automation Engineer | SQL, Power BI, Python
.
# Hi, I'm Vivian

I'm a **Process Automation Engineer** based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. I've been working in the industry for about 15 years, and I spend most of my time figuring out how to make repetitive tasks disappear and turn manual processes into automated workflows.

## Featured project

**[ETL Customer Sales Demo](https://github.com/mrvivian/ETL_CustomerSales_Demo)** – End-to-end pipeline: extract customer and sales data, clean and validate, load to a destination database.

- Shows the full flow (extract → transform → load) with real data quality checks
- Demonstrates SSIS and SQL Server in a portfolio-friendly, runnable format
- Illustrates how I design pipelines that are maintainable and auditable

## What I Actually Do

If you're wondering what a Process Automation Engineer does - I build systems that take the boring, time-consuming stuff off people's plates. That usually means:

- Writing scripts and tools that handle data processing automatically
- Building ETL pipelines so data flows where it needs to go without manual intervention
- Creating dashboards and reports that update themselves
- Integrating AI tools into business workflows (when it makes sense)
- Taking something that takes hours and making it take minutes

I work mostly with SQL, Power BI and Python.

## Some Things I've Built

### [Business Intelligence AI Assistant](https://github.com/mrvivian/business-intelligence-ai-assistant)
I built this because I was spending way too much time switching between tools and looking up metric definitions. It's a chatbot that helps with report creation and explains business metrics - runs completely locally using Ollama, so no API keys needed. Saves me hours every week.

**Built with:** Python, Flask, Ollama

### [ETL Customer Sales Demo](https://github.com/mrvivian/ETL_CustomerSales_Demo)
A complete ETL pipeline that pulls customer and sales data, cleans it up, runs quality checks, and loads it into a destination database. Shows the full process from extraction to final load.

**Built with:** SSIS, SQL Server

### [Power BI Portfolio](https://github.com/mrvivian/powerbi-portfolio)
A collection of Power BI dashboards I've built. Mostly focused on making data actually useful for decision-making rather than just pretty charts.

**Built with:** Power BI, DAX, SQL

### [PDF to CSV Converter](https://github.com/mrvivian/PDFtoCSVConverter)
Simple Python tool for extracting data from PDFs and converting to CSV. Built it because I needed it for a project, figured others might too.

**Built with:** Python

## Tech I Use Regularly

**Languages:** Python, C#, SQL  
**Tools:** Power BI, Flask, SSIS, Ollama, Git  
**Databases:** SQL Server (mostly)

I'm not particularly attached to any specific technology - I'll use whatever gets the job done efficiently.

## What I'm Working On

Currently focused on:
- Getting better at integrating AI/ML into practical business workflows
- Building more robust ETL solutions that handle edge cases gracefully
- Creating reusable templates and patterns for common automation tasks

*Most of my work is about making things easier for people. If I can automate it, I probably will.*
